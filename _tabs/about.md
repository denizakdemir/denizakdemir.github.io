# About Me

Hello! I'm **Deniz Akdemir**, a data scientist and researcher specializing in machine learning and biostatistical analysis. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, particularly in clinical and healthcare domains.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Applications**: Implementing advanced models for real-world problems, with a focus on tabular data analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Developing methods using autoencoders and rule-based techniques to identify patterns and outliers
- **Clinical Data Analysis**: Creating tools for healthcare data interpretation and quality assurance
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applied statistical analysis for evidence-based decision making

## Expertise

My technical toolkit includes:

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, transformer models, rule mining, anomaly detection
- **Visualization**: Data storytelling through effective visualizations

## Current Work

I'm currently exploring the application of transformer architectures to tabular data and developing near-deterministic rule mining techniques for anomaly detection in clinical datasets. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical applications in healthcare and biostatistics.
