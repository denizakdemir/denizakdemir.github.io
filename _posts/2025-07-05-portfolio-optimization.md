# Portfolio Optimization Using Mixed Models

## Executive Summary

This tutorial explores how mixed linear models from genomic prediction can enhance portfolio optimization. The key insight is that just as genomic models separate signal from noise in breeding values, we can use similar techniques to extract stable, predictable relationships between assets while filtering out transient market noise. This leads to more robust portfolio allocations that perform better out-of-sample.

## 1. Motivation: Why Genomic Methods for Portfolios? {#motivation}

Traditional portfolio optimization faces a fundamental challenge: sample covariance matrices are notoriously noisy, especially when the number of assets is large relative to the observation period. This leads to unstable portfolio weights that perform poorly out-of-sample.

In genomic prediction, researchers face a similar challenge: estimating breeding values for thousands of genetic markers with limited phenotypic observations. The solution? Mixed linear models that:

1. **Borrow information** across related observations
2. **Impose structure** through variance components
3. **Shrink estimates** toward more stable values
4. **Separate signal from noise** through random effects
