## Introduction
In this post, I will demonstrate how to build a personal blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. By the end, you will have a live website ready for publishing fresh content.

## Why GitHub Pages?
- **Free Hosting**: Deploy unlimited public repositories at no cost.
- **Built-In Jekyll Support**: Transform simple Markdown files into a polished site.
- **Easy Collaboration**: Use Git, pull requests, and GitHub’s workflow to maintain your blog.

## Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   Name your repository `yourusername.github.io` to make GitHub recognize it as a Pages site.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Go to **Settings** → **Pages**  
   - Select `main` as your branch and click **Save**.  
   - Your site URL will be `https://yourusername.github.io/`.

3. **Configure Jekyll**  
   - Create a `_config.yml` file in your repository.  
   - Specify your theme (e.g., `minima`) and other metadata, as shown in the example.

4. **Write Blog Posts**  
   - Place your Markdown posts under `_posts/` with a filename pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.  
   - Add Jekyll’s **front matter** to each post to define layout, date, title, and more.

5. **Customize**  
   - Modify `_config.yml` to add plugins, configure permalinks, and update site data.  
   - Explore other Jekyll themes on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/search?query=jekyll+theme) or GitHub Marketplace.

## Conclusion
Your GitHub Pages site is now ready to host your first blog post. Use this foundation to expand your blog, experiment with different themes, or even add a custom domain. If you encounter any issues, consult the [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) for step-by-step guidance.

> **Tip**: Commit regularly. Each commit triggers a rebuild of your Pages site, ensuring that your changes go live almost instantly.

Happy blogging!
