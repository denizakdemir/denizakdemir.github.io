This tutorial will walk you through how to write your very first post on the **Chirpy** template. Even if youâ€™ve used Jekyll before, this tutorial provides valuable tips on writing and formatting posts to work seamlessly within Chirpy.

## Creating a New Post

Start by creating a file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION` and place it in the `_posts` folder of your project. For example, name it `2025-02-13-writing-your-first-post.md`. The file extension should be `.md` or `.markdown`.
